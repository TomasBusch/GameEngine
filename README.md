# Game Engine

This is a personal project I started to learn C++ and graphics APIs. It is intended to be a 3D game engine with a customizable render pipleline using OpenGL, Vulkan, and DirectX12.

## Status

I'm currently working on the inputs layer and the RenderAPI backend for OpenGL, with windowing implemented with SDL3.
